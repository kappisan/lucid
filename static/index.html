		<h1>What is money?</h1>

		<p>Money is a medium of exchange, and it can take many forms. The money we use today, is money that has most probably been issued by a central bank. This money takes the form of pieces of paper and bits of metal that the bank creates and tells everyone that this is money. These mediums of exchange are somewhat difficult to create, so it is assumed that only the bank is able to create them, however this could not be further from the truth, with estimates of as many as 2.8% of all one pound coins being counterfeit[1]. Since good counterfeits go undetected, the true number in circulation will never be know.</p>
